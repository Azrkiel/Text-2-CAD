"""
Constraint-Based Assembly Schemas for Text-to-CAD Pipeline.

These Pydantic models define the strict inter-agent communication contract.
They are used as `response_schema` in Gemini API calls to enforce structured,
hallucination-resistant output from every subagent.

CORE RULE: All spatial relationships are TOPOLOGICAL and RELATIVE.
Absolute floating-point coordinates (x, y, z) are FORBIDDEN for mating.
Parts are connected via named anchor tags that reference CadQuery selectors.

    Each part is generated in COMPLETE ISOLATION — the Machinist receives only
    this definition and must produce a self-contained CadQuery script that
    creates the part centered at the origin. The part's relationship to the
    broader assembly is handled entirely by anchor_tags and MatingRules —
    the Machinist must NEVER embed assembly-level positioning logic.

    EXCEPTION — Coupled Geometric Subsystems (Domain D Aerospace):
    When a part represents a tightly coupled aerodynamic subsystem (e.g., a
    wing segment with internal ribs and spars), the Machinist is permitted —
    and REQUIRED — to generate the entire subsystem within a single self-
    contained script. This is necessary because internal structures depend on
    a shared tooling body (the ``inner_void`` — the directly-lofted airfoil
    core solid). Splitting such a subsystem across multiple PartDefinition
    entries makes it impossible to share that master geometry, causing ribs
    to clip through shell walls. In these cases the Machinist must produce a
    ``cq.Assembly`` containing all sub-bodies (skin, ribs, spars) and assign
    it to ``result``.
